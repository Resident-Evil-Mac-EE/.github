## Overview

Survival horror gaming combines atmospheric tension, resource scarcity, and combat encounters creating intense experiences where players face genuine threats. <a href="#">Resident Evil</a> perfected this formula through detailed environments populated by diverse enemies requiring strategic approaches rather than aggressive tactics alone.
